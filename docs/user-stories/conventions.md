**User Story file** contains its description. There are no structural conventions/restrictions for it.

**Use Case file** contains:
- Use Case Description
- List of Test Cases.

Use case description contains a sequence of steps. Each step makes some agent. In our project there are only two agents:
- User
- System

Each agent on each step can either make some action or some decision. 
User's actions have a names like U-xy there xy is a two digit number unic inside an use cases (among user's actions). 

Systems's actions have a numbers like S-xy there xy is a two digit number unic inside an use cases (among system's actions).

Desigions have a names like DU-xy (for user's decisions) and DS-xy (for system's decisions). 
A numbers in actions and decisions can be shorted to one digit or even omitted by short use cases. 

An action contains a name and either some action description or a name of some other use cases.

A decision contains a name and list of rules.
