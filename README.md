# PriTiSAn - Private Time Series Analyzer

PriTiSAn (Private Time Series Analyzer) is an application running in your browser, without using cloud data storage or similar, that allows users to collect and analyze their private and even intimate time-related data, mainly through visual representations.
 
The versatility of this tool allows users to track various aspects of their lives, including sleep patterns, dietary habits, budget dynamics on a monthly basis, etc.

One key feature that sets PriTiSAn apart is its commitment to user privacy. All data generated by the application remains securely stored within the user's browser memory and never leaves their computer. This ensures the utmost confidentiality and eliminates any concerns about data being saved in the cloud.

Currently in the early stages of development, PriTiSAn is a work in progress, and its full functionality is not yet available for use. We are actively working to enhance and refine the application, and we appreciate your patience as we strive to bring you a robust and reliable tool for personalized time series analysis. Stay tuned for updates as we continue to evolve PriTiSAn to meet your data analysis needs.
